## Content NOT Recommended for Homepage

### ❌ Avoid:
- Long mission statement (save for About page)
- Detailed service descriptions (save for service pages)
- Staff bios (save for Team page)
- Careers info (footer link is enough)
- Detailed insurance lists (save for Financial page)
- Full COVID protocols (link to dedicated page)
- Privacy policy full text (footer link only)

### Why:
- Homepage should be scannable in 10 seconds
- Too much text = decision paralysis
- People won't scroll past hero if overwhelmed
- Detail pages exist for a reason

---

## Key Metrics This Homepage Should Achieve

1. **Conversion:** Visitor → Appointment booked or phone call
2. **Clarity:** 3 seconds to understand what you offer
3. **Trust:** FQHC + insurance + affordability message visible immediately
4. **Accessibility:** Large CTAs, clear language, mobile-friendly
5. **Inclusivity:** Language services mentioned, diverse imagery

---

## Mobile Considerations

**Hero section:**
- Stack CTAs vertically
- Clickable phone number

**Services:**
- Stack to single column
- Larger touch targets

**Locations:**
- "Call" and "Directions" buttons should be native mobile actions

---

## Copy Tone & Voice

**Use:**
- "You" language (patient-focused)
- Active voice ("Schedule an appointment" not "Appointments can be scheduled")
- Plain language (avoid medical jargon)
- Warm, welcoming tone
- Inclusive language

**Avoid:**
- Corporate-speak
- Medical terminology without explanation
- Passive voice
- Intimidating language

---

## Image Strategy for Homepage

**Hero:** Happy, diverse family in clinical setting (professional but warm)

**Services section:** Icons or simple illustrations (not stock photos of random people)

**Locations:** Clean exterior shots of buildings

**Why Choose section:** Real staff photos with real patients (if possible, with consent)

**Avoid:**
- Generic stock photos
- All-white families only
- Clinical/sterile imagery
- No photos of actual facilities

---
