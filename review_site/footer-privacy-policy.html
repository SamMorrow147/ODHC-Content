<p><strong><em>Your medical information may be used and disclosed for the following purposes:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>TREATMENT:</strong> We may use your information to provide, coordinate, and manage your care and treatment. Prior written consent is required for these disclosures, except in the case of an emergency when it is not possible to obtain your consent.</p>
<p><strong>PAYMENT:</strong> We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive may be billed to, and payment may be collected from, you, and your insurance company, or another third party. We will obtain your written consent prior to making disclosures for payment purposes.</p>
<p><strong>HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS:</strong> We may use and disclose medical information about you for ODHC’s healthcare operations. Healthcare operations are the uses and disclosures of information that are necessary to run ODHC, and to make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. We will get your written consent prior to making disclosures to others outside of ODHC for healthcare operations purposes.</p>
<p><strong>APPOINTMENT REMINDERS &amp; OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION:</strong> We may use your medical information to send you reminders about future appointments. We may also send you refill reminders or other communications about your current medications. However, if we receive any financial remuneration for making such refill or medication communication beyond our costs of making the communication, we must first obtain your written authorization to make such communications. We may contact you with information about new or alternative treatments or health care services or for purposes of care coordination, unless we receive financial remuneration in exchange for making the communication. In that case, we will obtain your written authorization to make such communications. However, we are not required to obtain your written authorization for face-to-face communications.</p>
<p><strong>FUNDRAISING:</strong> ODHC may use certain information about you (specifically, your name, address, age, gender, date of birth or other demographic information; dates you received care from ODHC; department of service information; treating physician; outcome information and health insurance status) to let you know about fundraising or other charitable events. You have the right to opt-out of receiving such fundraising communication. Each fundraising communication you receive will include an opportunity to opt-out of future fundraising communications. Alternatively, you may notify ODHC’s Compliance Manager to opt-out of fundraising communications.</p>
<p><strong>TO PEOPLE ASSISTING IN YOUR CARE:</strong> ODHC will only disclose medical information to those taking care of you, helping you pay your bills, or other close family members or friends if these people need to know this information to help you, and then only to the extent permitted by law. We will ask for written consent prior to making disclosures about you to family or friends. If you are able to make your own health care decisions, ODHC will ask your permission before using your medical information for these purposes. If you are unable to make health care decisions, ODHC will disclose relevant medical information to family members or other responsible people if we feel it is in your best interest to do so, including in an emergency situation.</p>
<p><strong>RESEARCH:</strong> Federal law permits ODHC to use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes, either with your specific written authorization, or when the study has been reviewed for privacy protection by an Institutional Review Board or Privacy Board before the research begins. In some cases, researchers may be permitted to use information in a limited way to determine whether the study or the potential participants are appropriate. Minnesota law generally requires that we get your consent before we disclose your health information to an outside researcher. We will make a good faith effort to obtain your consent or refusal to participate in any research study, as required by law, prior to releasing any identifiable information about you to outside researchers.</p>

Any disclosure must be only to someone able to help prevent the threat. In addition, Minnesota law generally does not permit these disclosures unless we have your written consent, or when the disclosure is specifically required by law, including the limited circumstances in which ODHC health care professionals have a “duty to warn.”</p>

Usually, this includes medical and billing records maintained by ODHC. If you wish to inspect and copy medical information, you must submit your request in writing to the Health Information Specialist.

You may also direct us to transmit your health information (hard or electronic copy) directly to an entity or person clearly and specifically designated by you in writing. We may deny your  request to inspect and copy your information in limited circumstances. In these cases, we may supply the information to a third party who may release the information to you. If you are denied access to medical information, you may request that the denial be reviewed. Another licensed healthcare professional chosen by ODHC will review your request and the denial. The person conducting the review will not be the person who denied your request. We will comply with the outcome of the review.</p>

<p><strong>RIGHT TO REQUEST AMENDMENT:</strong> If you believe that medical information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to change the information. You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by or for ODHC. To request a change to your information, your request must be made in writing and submitted to the Health Information Specialist. In addition, you must provide a reason that supports your request. We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request.

▸ Is not part of the information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or ▸ Is accurate and complete.</p>
<p><strong>RIGHT TO REQUEST RESTRICTIONS:</strong> You have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the medical information we use or disclose about you. If you pay out-of-pocket in full for an item, or service, then you may request that we not disclose information pertaining solely to such item or service to your health plan for purposes of payment or health care operations. We are required to agree with such a request, unless you request a restriction on the information we disclose to a Health Maintenance Organization (“HMO”) and the law prohibits us from accepting payment from you above the cost-sharing amount for the item or service that is the subject of the requested restriction. However, we are not required to agree to any other request. If we do agree, we will comply with your request unless the information is needed to provide you emergency treatment or you request that we remove the restriction. To request restrictions, you must make your request in writing to the Health Information Specialist. In your request, you must tell us (1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit our use, disclosure, or both; and (3) to whom you want the limits to apply.</p>
<p><strong>RIGHT TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS:</strong> You have the right to request that we communicate with you about medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location.
