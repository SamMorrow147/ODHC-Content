Open Door Health Center


### Community Resources


As a Health Care Home, Open Door’s focus is not limited only to medical, dental, and behavioral health. We understand the barriers to wellness that a patient may have in their life. This could be lack of transportation or housing, relationship, legal or employment issues, or even food insecurity. 


Our team includes community health workers (CHW) who can connect you with resources within Open Door and within the community. Some of our partnering organizations that provide help to patients include:
