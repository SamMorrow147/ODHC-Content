### Sliding Fee Discount Program


For those who do not have insurance or have high deductible insurance, we offer a sliding fee discount program based on several factors,  

including income and household size.


We offer five levels of discounts to those who qualify. We do not quote this information over the phone but request a face-to-face interview to discuss your economic situation in more detail to best help you. When you come in to meet with one of our Patient Service Representatives, we ask that you bring with you one of the following for proof of income: W-2’s or pay stubs from the last month, your most recent Federal tax return, or social security or other public funding letters.
