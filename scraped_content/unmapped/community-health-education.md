Open Door Health Center


### Community Health



### **Community Outreach**


The purpose of Open Door Health Center’s Outreach Department is to educate the community on the available services at Open Door. We let the community know that  

Open Door is committed to providing healthcare for **all** members of the community. The Outreach staff go out into the communities of Southern Minnesota to help people connect to ODHC’s medical, dental, behavioral, and insurance enrollment services. In addition to these services, Outreach staff provide onsite classes and presentations on health-related topics.


If you have an event or other need our Outreach Department could help with, please email marketing@odhc.org.
